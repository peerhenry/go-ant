====== done
refactor
quad scene + cube scene
use normalmatrix uniform
textured cubes
automatically register uniforms
createBlock function for grass, dirt, stone, sand
user input: mouse & keyboard movement
move based on dt
render hud with text from text-atlas
add FPS
render chunk
rename world to scene
refactor/split up chunk builder
chunk coherence with chunk world or something
directional light: fix shader so light doesnt move with camera
render 16x16 chunks
remove face for adjacent chunks
height map usage
height atlas maps do not need to correspond with chunk size
perlin noise for height map
tree generation
fast move with SHIFT
perlin noise performance improvement
extract height generator
extract height atlas from chunk_world
prevent underground faces from being created
adequately spawn trees on generated chunks
refactor dropTree to dropstructure
toggle wireframe rendering
unload distant chunks
throttle chunk loading
player physics
fix jumping problem; seems like sometimes more than one jump call is made
fix collision with trees
keep minimal distance so you don't look through a face that's close
add basic crosshair
toggle noclip flying
fix voxel removal
voxel removal should updat adjacent chunks
digging should spawn underground chunks

====== in progress

====== next
fix voxels are not always removed on first click
fix underground snow blocks
fix adjacent chunk rendering problem (side faces of surface voxels along chunk edge are rendering)
player physics: fix "stuck" bug; sometimes a movement direction gets cancelled even though it shouldn't
player physics: deactivate player physics as long is world is not ready

====== todo
fix flowers spawning into trees
throttling: load chunks in order of distance to player
store world manipulations in memory
store world manipulations on disk
ambient light color uniform
frustum culling with chunks
keep chunks removed from rendering in memory
write a test for transforming empty chunk to render object
chunk.CalculateOrigin may be stored in memory as an optimization
antialiasing
implement world seed
transparent water
combine faces to reduce vertex data
debug draw chunk outline
optimize chunk mesh memory
refactor LoadImageFileToUniform to uniformStore
world generation on separate thread
optimize getCollidingVoxelAABBs in player.go
check if NORTH, EAST etc can be made int8
spawn grass

====== epics
biomes
swimming
voxel removal by click (ray intersection + chunk update)
skybox
shadows
water
quad tree LOD
